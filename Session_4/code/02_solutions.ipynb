      "[Document(metadata={'page': 33, 'source': './AI_Book.pdf'}, page_content='Types of Machine Learning Systems\\nThere are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to\\nclassify them in broad categories based on:\\n•Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsuper‐\\nvised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)\\n•Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch\\nlearning)\\n•Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points,\\nor instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much\\nlike scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)\\nThese criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them in any way you like. For\\nexample, a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural net‐\\nwork model trained using examples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, model-\\nbased, supervised learning system.\\nLet’s look at each of these criteria a bit more closely.\\nSupervised/Unsupervised Learning\\nMachine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of\\nsupervision they get during training. There are four major categories: supervised\\nlearning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learn‐\\ning.\\nSupervised learning\\nIn supervised learning , the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired\\nsolutions, called labels  (Figure 1-5 ).\\nFigure 1-5. A labeled training set for supervised learning (e.g., spam classification)\\n8 | Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape'), Document(metadata={'page': 40, 'source': './AI_Book.pdf'}, page_content='Figure 1-12. Reinforcement Learning\\nFor example, many robots implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms to learn\\nhow to walk. DeepMind’s AlphaGo program is also a good example of Reinforcement\\nLearning: it made the headlines in May 2017 when it beat the world champion Ke Jie\\nat the game of Go. It learned its winning policy by analyzing millions of games, and\\nthen playing many games against itself. Note that learning was turned off during the\\ngames against the champion; AlphaGo was just applying the policy it had learned.\\nBatch and Online Learning\\nAnother criterion used to classify Machine Learning systems is whether or not the\\nsystem can learn incrementally from a stream of incoming data.\\nBatch learning\\nIn batch learning , the system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained\\nusing all the available data. This will generally take a lot of time and computing\\nresources, so it is typically done offline. First the system is trained, and then it is\\nlaunched into production and runs without learning anymore; it just applies what it\\nhas learned. This is called offline  learning .\\nIf you want a batch learning system to know about new data (such as a new type of\\nspam), you need to train a new version of the system from scratch on the full dataset\\n(not just the new data, but also the old data), then stop the old system and replace it\\nwith the new one.\\nFortunately, the whole process of training, evaluating, and launching a Machine\\nLearning system can be automated fairly easily (as shown in Figure 1-3 ), so even a\\nTypes of Machine Learning Systems | 15'), Document(metadata={'page': 44, 'source': './AI_Book.pdf'}, page_content='Figure 1-15.

This is called model-based learning\\n(Figure 1-16 ).\\nFigure 1-16.

Reinforcement Learning (RL):\\n- RL algorithms learn through trial and error, applying policies to find winning strategies for games or activities.\\n\\nThese categories allow for flexibility in how ML systems can be classified based on the training process, their ability to adapt to changes, and the methods used to build predictive models from data.
